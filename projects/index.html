<li><h3> Stock Visualizer and Forecaster </h3></li>
<p><u><a href="https://dundun.shinyapps.io/stockForecast/">Click Here to see the Stock Forecasting App</a></u></p>
<p> You choose a stock ticker. This app will web-scrape the data, decompose the stock's time series, and then forecast it. Forecasts are made 
with statistical models 'ARIMA' and 'VARMAX'. The ARIMA model first decomposes a time series into its three components 'seasonal', 'trend', and 'cycle.' 
Then, those components are used as building blocks to create the forecast. The VARMAX statistical forecasting model is an extended version of an ARIMA model. 
The VARMAX model incorporates exogenous input in an attempt to further improve the models accuracy beyond the ARIMA.

<p> Last summer, with The Department for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin I did a research program in Biomedical Data Science. 
There, I studied large quantity of data on the effects of lingual exercise on the oropharyngeal swallow and dysphagia.
With over 1000 observations and over 20 variables, the overwhelming data was often very dense, complicated, and hard to understand.
During my time there, I made an interactive web application with "Shiny" and "RStudio" that allowed for easier visualization and understanding of the data.
The app allows for more versatility in duration parameters, observing changes in durations over time, and helps find unusual 
observations. This allowed for a more comprehensive exploration of the data. In short, the application allows you to change the parameters 
and variables so that you can see the parts of the data that you want, without the rest. Check it out for yourself, its live at
