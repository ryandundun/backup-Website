	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ryan Dundun</h1>
		<p>Hosted on my Github repository, my HTML code is linked to a CSS code file. <br/> 
			Furthermore, Jekyll -a ruby gem parsing engine- constructs the pages to this static website. <br/>  
		I am currently working on automating repetitive tasks to save time at <a href="https://irobotyze.github.io">iRobotyze</a><br/>
	In partnership with iCarted too.
